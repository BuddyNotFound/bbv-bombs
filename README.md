**BBVxWORLD Bombs** allows you to plant and defuse bomb, works with QB/ESX and it requires [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
It is also compatible with **OX/QB/BT** targets.

The player who plants the bomb can choose the wire that needs to be cut and the difficulty of the minigame. Additionally, they can create a defuse pin that can be used by themselves or anyone who knows it to defuse the bomb.

All bomb data is synchronized between players and is deleted upon server restart..
